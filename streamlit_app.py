In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader('Upload pdf file:')
if uploaded_file is not None:
    dfs = tabula.read_pdf(uploaded_file, pages="all")
    for df in dfs:
        df.to_excel('df_test.xlsx')
        st.download_button(label='ðŸ“¥ Download Current Result',
                                data=df)
